# Classification-ExplorationGestationalThyroidDisease

Dear visitor, 

in this repository, you shall find the Python and R code to reproduce the statistical results of my the 
MSc. thesis "Thyroid disease prediction and symptom exploration during early pregnancy - a machine learning approach towards obstetrical psychopathology".
Data disclosure was not allowed to the public, so toy data or another ordinal dataset can be used. 

Kind regards,

Sitaldin, N.
